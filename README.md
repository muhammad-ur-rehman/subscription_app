# Subscription Plans

The challenge is to match as closely as you are able the image below "subscription_plans.png" and to represent this as a page on a rails application.

* The "Get Started" button should POST to a an endpoint on a new rails application.
* The received action should update a Company record with a subscription_plan field to the new value of the plan.
* A message should be displayed to the customer that their plan was updated.
* Make the page responsive and viewable on a mobile device. This should just be visible on a mobile phone.

# Results
* How you design the form and use CSS.
* Can I select my plan of a phone-sized screen? Can I select it on a wide desktop screen?
* How the page matches the image.
* How you lay out the form in Rails and make use of data for the layout.
* That the form actually submits and the table is updated.
* That a message is displayed to the customer.
